### notes / todo
There's some fun stuff that could be done with this data. We have reviews, delivery times, delivery distances etc.
These provide opportunity for both feature engineering for different tasks and interesting hypotheses to test,
e.g. the effects of delivery times, location remoteness, or review favourability of the customer on churn.

For now, let's focus on the demand forecasting problem.

Apparently there's some bias due to the fact that only orders where a review was left were sampled.
